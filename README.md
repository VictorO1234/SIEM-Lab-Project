# SIEM-Lab-Project
Hands-on SIEM project using Elasticsearch, Kibana, and Winlogbeat. Configured log collection from Windows VM, built dashboards for login activity, and analysed security events.

This project demonstrates the setup and use of a Security Information and Event Management (SIEM) system in a virtualized lab environment.
It was designed to replicate real-world SOC workflows, including log collection, event monitoring, and dashboarding for threat detection.

ðŸ”¹ Objectives

Install and configure Elasticsearch & Kibana on Ubuntu VM.

Configure Winlogbeat on a Windows VM to forward security event logs.

Collect and visualise logs for user logins, failed logins, and PowerShell activity.

Build Kibana dashboards to detect suspicious activity and monitor authentication trends.

ðŸ”¹ Key Features

Data Ingestion: Windows Event Logs (4624 â€“ Successful Logon, 4625 â€“ Failed Logon).

Dashboards:

Login trends over time (successful vs failed).

Top usernames from failed logins.

Failed logins by source IP.

Use Case: Identify brute-force attempts, monitor user behavior, and improve visibility into endpoint activity.

ðŸ”¹ Tools & Technologies

Elasticsearch â€“ log storage and indexing.

Kibana â€“ data visualization and dashboards.

Winlogbeat â€“ log forwarder from Windows Event Viewer.

VirtualBox â€“ lab virtualization.

ðŸ”¹ Results

Successfully built a working SIEM pipeline.

Detected and visualized successful vs failed logins.

Created actionable dashboards for SOC-style monitoring.
